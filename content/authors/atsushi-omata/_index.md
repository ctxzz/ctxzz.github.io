        UK-Japan Network project.
        The work of the Network aims to address an area of major concern for both countries ‚Äì that of increasing population of people living with dementia. Environmental design has been shown to be an effective means of improving people‚Äôs experiences of living with the condition, but there is a need for better evidence which takes account of cross-national and cross-cultural differences and similarities, and a need for the experience in each country to provide lesson for the other. The Network seeks to work internationally to generate an agenda for further research into these areas.
