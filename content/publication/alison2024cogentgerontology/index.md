abstract: A multidisciplinary Japanâ€“UK Network identified cross-cultural and cross-national lessons for research aimed at improving the design of homes for people living with dementia. Previous research has suggested that improved, multidimensionally sustainable design may improve quality of life for people living with dementia and meet societal challenges of increasing populations of people with the condition. Adopting a social citizenship perspective, the paper argues that people living with dementia are considered equal citizens with rights to enjoy the life they choose. On this basis, research on home design must be underpinned by understanding the concept of home. The definition of good outcomes should be led by people living with dementia. Conceptualisation of costs of design innovations is complex and will involve judgements from a societal perspective. Methodologically, an ethnographic approach is desirable, underpinned by co-production. These points are suggested to inform further research. In conclusion, the paper confirms the value of cross-cultural insights.
