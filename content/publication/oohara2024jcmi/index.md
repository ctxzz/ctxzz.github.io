abstract: "There are many young people who have difficulty in living. This study was conducted to analyze the records of chat consultation services, with the aim of clarifying the trends of their problems and support patterns. We analyzed what kind of users the chat consultation service is in demand, what kind of worries the counselors have, and what kind of support the supporters provide. The consultants were mostly concerned with school- and work-related issues, and the results of labeling by LLM showed that positive responses by supporters tended to influence their feelings and wellbeing. On the other hand, in the cases where the support was unsuccessful, the lack of altruistic behavior of the supporters toward the consultants could be one of the reasons for this. The results of these analyses may be used as data for improving the quality and effectiveness of support for people with similar problems."
