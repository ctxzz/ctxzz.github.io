abstract: People with dementia may benefit from appropriate care. Understanding care interactions provide meaningful insight into social communication skills. The purpose of this paper is to construct an annotation scheme to represent expert knowledge and to verify whether it leads to the evaluation of care interactions. Focusing on the dementia care method by Humanitude, we have designed an annotation scheme and annotation structure. A multimodal behavior analysis system has been developed to analyze care interaction between caregivers and people with dementia. The point of our system is that it can generate a deep interpretation of care without experts. The video data which we have collected at a hospital have been analyzed, the features of skills and care interactions were extracted. These results are a part of the findings of empirical analysis of building human relationships.
