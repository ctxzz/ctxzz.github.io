abstract: For realizing a safe and secure care environment in the COVID-19 environment, we have constructed a system that multi-modally senses the behavior of indoor ventilation of care staffs. We have collected multimodal sensing data for 2 months at the nursing care facility site. The developed system has visualized the actual situation in which the staff is operating the ventilation by using air conditioners and opening and closing windows based on their own bodily feelings and the characteristics of the scene situations. As the result of data analysis by the system, the difference in environmental adjustment skills for each staff has clarified.
